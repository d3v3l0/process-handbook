# How to create user personas

Help your team stay focussed 
on building _exactly_ what 
the people using your product _really_ want.

</div>

<br />

## Why?

Personas help us picture and _empathise_ with 
the _people_ using our product.
This is key to the success of the product 
for ensuring that it is built 
to address the person's needs 
as opposed to fulfilling the subjective vision 
of the creators or the convenience of the team building it. 
Personas provide a precise definition 
of the _person_ using the product, 
rather than a nebulous "user on the site/app". 
Personas remind the team of the *motives* and reasons *why* 
people _need_ it to offer the functionality that is being built. 
Keeping these reasons at the forefront of the teams mind 
can have significant impacts on the delivery of the end product. 
Not convinced how the _why_ makes a difference,

## What?

A persona is _usually_<sup>1</sup> a fictional character 
created to represent the type of person 
that is using the product in a particular way. 
The format in which they are written can vary
according to the needs of the project.
This tutorial will focus on 
["proto personas"](http://uxmag.com/articles/using-proto-personas-for-executive-alignment).
Proto personas are ideal for projects 
that are short on time / allocated resources
but that want to get the core benefits 
that using personas has to offer.

Here's an example of a persona for a site 
([ClubSoda](https://github.com/club-soda/club-soda-guide)) 
that helps people find non / low alcohol drinks options 
and the venues that serve them. 
So the context of the persona is around her background with alcohol and her balance of drinking:

![Persona, Nisha the Consumer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004041-d5933300-c0a9-11e8-9c97-c7ea0ad38d9e.png "Persona, Nisha the Consumer")

## Who?

_Anyone_ can create personas;
it's not exclusive to the "Product Manager/Owner" or "UX Designer".
In fact if you have _any_ role in a small team,
taking the _initiative_ to create personas
is a great way of showing leadership.
Even _solo_ entrepreneurs building products (Websites/Apps/Games/etc.)
can benefit _immensely_ from having personas.
They are a way of _focussing_ our attention 
on the _human being_ whose problem we are solving
and not getting distracted 
building shiny features nobody _asked_ for!
We print them out 
and stick them on our walls
as a _constant_ reminder.
As you will see from our template + instructions below,
it's incredibly easy to create a persona in less than 5 minutes.
There's really no excuse _not_ to do it. 

## How?

A persona should include:

- Name, Category & Photo — names that are an alliteration 
with the group that they represent are useful 
e.g. "Sophie, the Student". 
Accompany this with a photo or illustration of them.
- Age (_don't be afraid to be specific_)
- Job Title + Organisation/Company (_if applicable_)
- Background - given that personas represent 
a type of person using the product, 
think about what core background characteristics 
or attributes might be typical for this kind of persona. 
You may be able to recognise these types from UX research
interviews you've conducted.
- Why do they need your product? — What problems can your product solve for them?
Why would using your product benefit them?
- Pain points - What is it that they struggle with at the moment in the domain
of your product? What problems could you solve for them (even if it's not
currently being addressed by the product)? What might put them off of using your
product?

Once you've created your cards you should print them and display them on the wall
near your team. This means the team has easy access to remind themselves of them.
You should refer to your user personas when writing user stories to give specific
context for the purpose behind writing them.

The personas are also beneficial for introducing new team members or stakeholders
with your end user groups.

Personas can be tailored to the unique needs and goals of your project according
to what you see relevant. For example you might want to use a quantifiable pain
points scale:

### Examples

Here are some more examples of personas 
from the project to help people find low or no alcohol drinks 
and the venues that serve them. 
These personas are for the drinks brands, 
venue managers and the staff from the organisation behind the site.
They consider their involvement and presence on the site 
and how it can benefit them.
The first two personas are fictional representations 
of the two types of people using the App,
whereas the last persona (Jussi)
is a _real_ person who is one of the admins of the App:

![Persona, Bradley the Brand Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004238-49354000-c0aa-11e8-801b-858d137f6b1b.png "Persona, Bradley the Brand Manager")
![Persona, Vicky the Venue Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004426-cb256900-c0aa-11e8-8faa-31878125a4d4.png "Persona, Vicky the Venue Manager")
![Persona, Jussi from Club Soda](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/46004730-7c2c0380-c0ab-11e8-96b1-267bdc416001.png "Persona, Jussi from Club Soda")


## Make Your Own _Instructions_ 

### 1. Photos / Images

You don't _need_ to have a picture for your persona,
but it definitely helps to _personify_ them 
and it doesn't have to take more than a couple of minutes
to get or _make_ one.

If you don't _aready_ have great drawing skills 
(_or the time/patience to learn_),
then Bitmoji 
[bitmoji.com](https://www.bitmoji.com)
is a great 



## Notes

<sup>1</sup>Personas are _usually_ fictional representations
of a typical person using a product. 
This is to avoid subject of the persona feeling like self-concious.
However in the case where you are building a feature 
for a very specific person 
(_e.g. your "boss" if you're building a specific feature of an internal tool like a sales dashboard_)
the persona is very clearly a person we _know_
and can describe them precisely to help the team focus.
That is the case of this last persona ("Jussi")
who is a an _actual_ person we all know and love.
Having a well defined persona 
for the _real_ person using the product
can be _even more_ useful than a fictional one.
We just need to be careful to only use people
who have given their consent to be personafied.
