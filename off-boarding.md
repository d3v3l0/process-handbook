# dwyl off-boarding process

From time to time, people move on to pastures fresh. 
This document is a checklist for how to make this as easy and painless for the _dwyler_ as well as for _dwyl_.

## The _dwyler_ should...

* [ ] Book any holidays as soon as possible
* [ ] Make sure to submit any expense claims in good time, so they can be settled along with your final invoice/payslip
* [ ] Search through all open issues / pull requests assigned to you on github and ensure you've provided some sort of resolution
* [ ] If you're the "account owner" for any SaaS / hosting / etc providers, transfer ownership 
to the dwyl `dev` "master account" (ask for details if you don't know)
* [ ] Unsubscribe from email subscriptions you use your dwyl email address for (search your inbox for "unsubscribe")
* [ ] Change account details for anything _personal_ you've signed up for with your dwyl address
* [ ] Return any books to the `library`
* [ ] Return your set of office keys
* [ ] Return any company hardware - e.g. laptop, iPad
* [ ] Confirm your contact details with dwyl in case we need to send anything on / contact you for some reason
* [ ] Download any files in your Google account that you might need - 
your email address will only be kept active for one month after your last day
  * Freelancers: note that copies of all of your invoices are sent to your email address, 
  and you might well want to hang onto those for your records
  * PAYE dwylers: your payslips might also be sent to your email address, so you should definitely download those - 
  **your Xero Payroll login will expire 14 days after your final day**
* Note: your relationship with the pension provider is between you and them only, 
and this won't change (other than dwyl no longer paying into your pot!)

## _dwyl_ will...

* [ ] Inform clients / suppliers of your departure, or confirm to you that you may do so yourself
* [ ] Arrange a friendly exit interview with you
* [ ] Ensure your expenses are settled along with your final payslip
* [ ] Ensure you're paid for any accrued holiday you've not yet taken
* [ ] Ensure any changes to credentials / account details / etc are `propagated` (e.g. updating Google docs)
* [ ] Revoke your access to any private `github` repositories
* [ ] Send you your `P45` form to give to your new HR department / for your records
